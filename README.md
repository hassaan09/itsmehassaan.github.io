**Overview:**
This is an HTML, CSS-based website, which is designed to meet Norman’s 7 principles of design. The website is a Trip-Planner website, which is aimed to showcase the beautiful Places in Pakistan.
Some Amazing CSS properties are implemented which adds to the aesthetics of the website.

**Norman’s 7 Principles of Design:**  
I have tried to integrate almost all the design principles we studied so far. Starting from the basics:-  

**Visibility of System Status**  👁️ is ensured all along the website so the user doesn’t get lost at any place.  

**Match With the Real World** 🗺️  is made sure by using objects and real-world metaphors.  

**User Freedom** 🗽 The User is being provided with the liberty of navigating through the app, so is ensured. 

**Design consistency** 🔄 is made possible by using similar font styles, indentations, etc.  

**Recognition rather than recall**  📢 is quite widely used to offload memory burden from the user.  

**Error Prevention** 🔒 is made possible by an error message that prevents the user from going to the next page without completing the previous requirements.  

**Flexibility** 💻📱 is ensured as the website is responsive and caters to the needs of Windows as well as any other device, which makes it a flexible product.
